For example:
- converting `int` to `float`
- converting `float` to `int`
- converting `char` to `int`

## ❓ Why Type Casting is Used

- To get accurate results in calculations
- To avoid unexpected output
- To control how data is interpreted by the compiler
- To manage decimal values properly

---

## 🎯 Need of Type Casting

- C performs operations based on data types
- Without type casting, some calculations may lose data
- Type casting helps in handling precision
- It allows proper assignment between different data types

---

## 📂 Programs Included

- Implicit type casting examples
- Explicit type casting examples
- Integer and floating-point division
- Observing results before and after casting
